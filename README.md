## TRAMS API Document

The TRAMS (Trust and Academy Management System) system acts as a data source for SDD's digital services supporting Academies and Free Schools. We're working on a set of RESTful APIs to allow digital services to consume data from TRAMS and to feed back data necessary for completing projects.

The document is maintained here as a central contract so systems can develop against a consistent API while it is in development. It's generated and viewable using (Swagger)[swagger.io]
